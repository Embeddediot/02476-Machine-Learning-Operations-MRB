## Overall goal of the project
## What framework are you going to use (PyTorch Image Models, Transformer, Pytorch-Geometrics)
## How to you intend to include the framework into your project
To include PyTorch Transformers in our NLP project, we would first select a pre-trained language model from the library, fine-tune it on our dataset, preprocess the tweets, and use the model to make predictions. We would then evaluate the model's performance and make any necessary adjustments.
## What data are you going to run on (initially, may change)
## What deep learning models do you expect to use
